# Simple Blockchain

A simple implementation of a PoW blockchain in Python3 geared towards clarity of concept and simplicity in implementation.

The goal of this project is to serve as an educational tool and reference for learning.

## Getting started

### Dependencies

```
Python 3.6.x
```

### How to run

```bash
# python3 run.py
```

## Notes

This project represents a single node in a networkless PoW based cryptocurrency system. As such it does not cover various concepts such as:

1. Peer networking and message passing
2. Best chain detection and replacement
3. More sophisticated consensus rules validation
4. Chain persistence
